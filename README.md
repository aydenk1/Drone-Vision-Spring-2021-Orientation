# Drone-Vision-Spring-2021-Orientation

## Step 1. Setup Linux Environment
Working in a linux environment will be essential to running software for the drone vision team. There are many ways to acheive this, with tons of ways to mess up as well. Please   feel free to ask Justin or I if you run into problems.

### - Windows
- Dual Booting: Prefered Method, but harder. -~1 TB storage and 8 GB Flash Drive are required
  - Please read this artical, which helps to explain how to dual boot. https://www.howtogeek.com/214571/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-pc/ I recommend Kubuntu, because it is the most easy to use in my opinion.

- WSL
  - Installation tutorial https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10. Ubuntu will be the distro you should install
