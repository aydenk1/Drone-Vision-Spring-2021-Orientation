## Step 1. Setup Linux Environment
Working in a linux environment will be essential to running software for the drone vision team. There are many ways to acheive this, with tons of ways to mess up as well. Please   feel free to ask Justin or I if you run into problems.

### A. Dual Booting: Prefered Method, but harder - Windows Only with ~1 TB storage and 8 GB or 
Please read this artical, which helps to explain how to dual boot. https://www.howtogeek.com/214571/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-pc/

#### 1. You will need to shrink your main partition to make room for the Linux OS. I recommend shrinking your main partition (typically called C:) by 200 GB, since many packages, datasets, and video outputs that will be used require large amounts of space. Don't worry about installing Windows, since you likely have that already

#### 2. Aquire a linux distro. I recommend Kubuntu, because it is the most easy to use in my opinion.
